			<p>Cloud computing is named as such because the information being accessed is found remotely in the cloud or 
			a virtual space. Companies that provide cloud services enable users to store files and applications on remote 
			servers and then access all the data via the Internet. This means the user is not required to be in a specific 
			place to gain access to it, allowing the user to work remotely.</p>
			<p>Cloud computing takes all the heavy lifting involved in crunching and processing data away from the device you 
			carry around or sit and work at. It also moves all of that work to huge computer clusters far away in cyberspace. 
			The Internet becomes the cloud, and voilà—your data, work, and applications are available from any device with which 
			you can connect to the Internet, anywhere in the world.</p>
			<p>Cloud computing can be both public and private. Public cloud services provide their services over the Internet for a fee. 
			Private cloud services, on the other hand, only provide services to a certain number of people. These services are a system 
			of networks that supply hosted services. There is also a hybrid option, which combines elements of both the public and private 
			services.</p>
