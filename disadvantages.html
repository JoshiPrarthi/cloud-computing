			Disadvantages Of Cloud Computing
		</div><br>
		<img src="disadvantage.png" alt="Disadvantage"/>
		<p>With all of the speed, efficiencies, and innovations that come with cloud computing, there are, naturally, risks.</p>
		<p>Security has always been a big concern with the cloud especially when it comes to sensitive medical records and financial information. 
		While regulations force cloud computing services to shore up their security and compliance measures, it remains an ongoing issue. Encryption 
		protects vital information, but if that encryption key is lost, the data disappears.</p>
		<p>Servers maintained by cloud computing companies may fall victim to natural disasters, internal bugs, and power outages, too. The geographical 
		reach of cloud computing cuts both ways: A blackout in California could paralyze users in New York, and a firm in Texas could lose its data if 
		something causes its Maine-based provider to crash.</p>
		<p>As with any technology, there is a learning curve for both employees and managers. But with many individuals accessing and manipulating information 
		through a single portal, inadvertent mistakes can transfer across an entire system.</p>
