		<div class="two">
			<p>Cloud computing is the delivery of different services through the Internet. These resources include tools 
			and applications like data storage, servers, databases, networking, and software.</p>
			<p>Rather than keeping files on a proprietary hard drive or local storage device, cloud-based storage makes it 
			possible to save them to a remote database. As long as an electronic device has access to the web, it has access 
			to the data and the software programs to run it.</p>
			<p>Cloud computing is a popular option for people and businesses for a number of reasons including cost savings, 
			increased productivity, speed and efficiency, performance, and security.</p>
