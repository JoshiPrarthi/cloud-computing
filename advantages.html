			Advantages Of Cloud Computing
		</div><br>
		<img src="advantage.jpeg" alt="Advantage"/>
		<p>Cloud-based software offers companies from all sectors a number of benefits, including the ability to use 
		software from any device either via a native app or a browser. As a result, users can carry their files and 
		settings over to other devices in a completely seamless manner.</p>
		<p>Cloud computing is far more than just accessing files on multiple devices. Thanks to cloud computing services, 
		users can check their email on any computer and even store files using services such as Dropbox and Google Drive.
		Cloud computing services also make it possible for users to back up their music, files, and photos, ensuring those 
		files are immediately available in the event of a hard drive crash.</p>
		<p>It also offers big businesses huge cost-saving potential. Before the cloud became a viable alternative, companies 
		were required to purchase, construct, and maintain costly information management technology and infrastructure. Companies 
		can swap costly server centers and IT departments for fast Internet connections, where employees interact with the cloud 
		online to complete their tasks.</p>
		<p>The cloud structure allows individuals to save storage space on their desktops or laptops. It also lets users upgrade software 
		more quickly because software companies can offer their products via the web rather than through more traditional, tangible methods 
		involving discs or flash drives. For example, Adobe customers can access applications in its Creative Cloud through an Internet-based 
		subscription.This allows users to download new versions and fixes to their programs easily.</p>
